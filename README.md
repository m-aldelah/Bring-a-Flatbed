# Overview

Bring a Flatbed is an online auction house for cheap hobbyist cars. The main purpose
of this application is to allow users to sell cars in less-than-ideal conditions, and for
buyers to bid during a 7-day auction. Sellers and buyers can communicate with each
other via comment sections which are used for constructive questions. The goals of
this application are:
● Allow sellers to list their less-than-ideal condition cars
● Allow buyers to bid on cars during a 7-day auction
● Minimize typical buyer fees
